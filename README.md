EECS 563 Homework Template
==========================

Creating an assignment repo:
----------------------------

Use this script: [start\_563\_homework.sh](https://gist.github.com/caseyjackmiles/709a74f7a367de5daa3d)

After creating assignment repo:
--------------------------------------------

1. `cd` into the root directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install Node packages
3. Run Grunt tasks with `npm start`
    * This was done because we cannot install grunt-cli globally (no sudo privileges)
